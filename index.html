          <p>I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. I graduated from UC Irvine in 2011 with a Bachelor's of Science in Sociology. Afterwards I worked
            at my family's engineering firm while pursuing my passion of combining music and animation.</p>
          <p>Some of my other interests include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Movies</li>
            <li>Basketball</li>
            <li>Martial Arts</li>
          </ul>
          <p>As a student at Thinkful, I'm excited to start a new career in a field with so many possibilities! If you're looking to hire a new developer please 
            reach out. I'm looking forward to the opportunity of working with other developers on innovative new ideas.</p>
